To run the full code using MUI X DataGrid Premium with a custom searchable dropdown filter, you'll need to install the following packages:


---

✅ Required Installations

1. Material UI Core

npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

2. MUI X DataGrid Premium

npm install @mui/x-data-grid-premium

> ⚠️ Note: The @mui/x-data-grid-premium package requires a commercial license from MUI. If you don’t have one, you can use:



@mui/x-data-grid-pro – for most advanced features

or @mui/x-data-grid – for basic features (without advanced filtering)


If you're using Pro instead of Premium, update imports like this:

import { DataGridPro } from '@mui/x-data-grid-pro';


---

Optional: Icons (for UI)

npm install @mui/icons-material


---

Final List of Installations

If you want to copy and paste everything at once:

npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/x-data-grid-premium @mui/icons-material


---

📌 Node Version

Ensure you're using Node.js v14 or higher, and ideally React 17 or 18.

Would you like a version of the code using @mui/x-data-grid-pro instead (in case you don't have a premium license)?
